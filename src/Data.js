    post: `Hey, In this huge bundles of blog already having a separate fan base who am I ?
        (That no one knows we are given birth to figure it out!) Okay keeping philosophy aside 
        I am one of those who are struggling to find their dreams and make them true , 
        yes talking about us all we all want that. Currently I am exploring some skills which includes web development , graphic designing and pursuing Btech in computer science 
        frankly speaking to all the same question struck in mind that why will people be reading my articles in the vast ocean where there are millions already but , 
        I decided to do it not to have a large crowd in my articles I wish that happens but the primary goal is to reach out to those who are sharing same page with me. 
        I may have a bit of knowledge to make their journey a little smoother and also because I wanted to brush up my writing skills.
         I hope I bought about a little positive change in your life if you are reading this uptill here.
        Itâ€™s a humble request write a comment down about the experience of reading me for the first time weather it be a criticism or applause both will be appreciated have a great time ahead!`,
